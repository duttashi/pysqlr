### README

While writing code, often it happens that certain common tasks are repetitive in nature. For example, sort a column of values in increasing or decreasing order, or find duplicate values in a column. Although, the underlyig logic of solving such problems remain the same, **but** it's their implementation that differs. In this space, I'll make an attempt to answer such problems using 3 different implementation tools, namely, `R`, `Python-3` and `MySQL`.
