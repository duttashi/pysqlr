## PowerBI (PBI) Essentials

This page explains the PBI terminologies.

### Dataflow
- Dataflow is a Power Query process that runs in the cloud independently from any Power BI reports.
- Dataflow stores the data in the Azure Data Lake storage.
	Azure Data Lake storage is Microsoft cloud storage that can store structured data (like tables) and unstructured data (like files).
- Dataflow is created on the PBI website. 
- The whole process of storing data into Azure Data Lake is internally managed through Dataflow. You won’t even need to login to the Azure portal or anywhere else. 
- Developing or Editing Dataflows are possible through Power BI service (not the Desktop)
- Dataflow is only available in an app workspace (not in “My workspace”)
