### The components of Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

Reference: [components of ERD](https://www.studytonight.com/dbms/er-diagram.php); [good explanation on ERD](http://jcsites.juniata.edu/faculty/rhodes/dbms/ermodel) [more on ERD](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/er-diagrams)


#### Components of ER Diagram
Entitiy, Attributes, Relationships etc form the components of ER Diagram and there are defined symbols and shapes to represent each one of them.

Let's see how we can represent these in our ER Diagram.

##### Entity
 An entity is an object or concept about which you want to store information.
Simple rectangular box represents an Entity.

##### Weak Entity
A weak Entity is represented using double rectangular boxes. It is generally connected to another entity. Weak entity is an entity that depends on another entity. Weak entity doesn't have anay key attribute of its own. Double rectangle is used to represent a weak entity.

##### Relationship
Rhombus is used to setup relationships between two or more entities. (single rhombus shows relationship; rhombus within rhombus shows weak relationship)

##### Attribute
An Attribute describes a property or characterstic of an entity. For example, Name, Age, Address etc can be attributes of a Student. An attribute is represented using eclipse.
It is connected to the entity.

##### Key attribute
Key attribute represents the main characterstic of an Entity. It is used to represent a Primary key. Ellipse with the text underlined, represents Key Attribute.

##### Derived attribute
Derived attributes are those which are derived based on other attributes, for example, age can be derived from date of birth.

To represent a derived attribute, another dotted ellipse is created inside the main ellipse.

##### Composite Attribute

An attribute can also have their own attributes. These attributes are known as Composite attributes.
